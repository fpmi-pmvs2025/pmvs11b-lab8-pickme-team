# Game Rules

## Objective
The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same numbers to create a tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play
1. Use swipe gestures to move all tiles in one of four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values
3. After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell
4. The game ends when:
   - You create a tile with the number 2048 (you win!)
   - You can't make any more moves (you lose)

## Scoring
- Each merge adds the value of the new tile to your score
- Try to achieve the highest score possible
